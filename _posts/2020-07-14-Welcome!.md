Hi! Glad you could stop by. I'm Richard and I've been a web developer since early 2020. I'm very excited to be working in this field.
I currently work for Amazon in one of their fulfillment centers full time. My goal is to become a react front end web developer within the next few months. I spend
most of my time outside of work sharpening my coding skills. I've been primarily focused on react. Also, I plan on collaborating on projects 
that are on github and hackathons. I'm really trying to soak up all I can and really make a change in the direction of my life.
